Creating a Tile Server From Ingested, Sentinel Data
****************************************************

Now that we have ingested data, we can use it using a tile server.
We will be using the catalog that was created in :ref:`sentinel_ingest_example`.

**Note**: This guide will focus on converting the raster into a ``PIL`` RGB
image so that it can be used by the tile server. The tile server process itself
is discussed in more detail in :ref:`Greyscale Tile Server Code Breakdown
<server_break_down>`.

The Code
=========

Because we are working with a RGB, a multiband image, we will need to correct the
colors for each tile in order for it to displayed correctly.

.. code:: python

  import io
  import numpy as np
  import rasterio

  from flask import Flask, make_response
  from PIL import Image

  from geopyspark.geopycontext import GeoPyContext
  from geopyspark.geotrellis.catalog import read_value
  from geopyspark.geotrellis.constants import SPATIAL


  # normalize the data so that it falls in the range of 0 - 255
  def make_image(arr):
      adjusted = ((arr - whole_min) * 255) / (whole_max - whole_min)
      return Image.fromarray(adjusted.astype('uint8')).resize((256, 256), Image.NEAREST).convert('L')


  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/<int:zoom>/<int:x>/<int:y>.png")
  def tile(x, y, zoom):
      # fetch tile

      tile = read_value(geopysc, SPATIAL, uri, layer_name, zoom, x, y)
      arr = tile['data']

      bands = arr.shape[0]
      arrs = [np.array(arr[x, :, :]).reshape(256, 256) for x in range(bands)]

      # display tile
      images = [make_image(arr) for arr in arrs]
      image = Image.merge('RGB', images)

      bio = io.BytesIO()
      image.save(bio, 'PNG')
      response = make_response(bio.getvalue())
      response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'image/png'
      response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'filename=%d.png' % 0

      return response


  if __name__ == "__main__":
      uri = "file:///tmp/sentinel-catalog"
      layer_name = "sentinel-example"

      geopysc = GeoPyContext(appName="s3-flask", master="local[*]")

      with open('/tmp/sentinel_stats.txt', 'r') as f:
          lines = f.readlines()
          whole_max = int(lines[0])
          whole_min = int(lines[1])

      app.run()

Running the Code
-----------------

Running the tile server is done the same way as in :ref:`Greyscale Tile Server
Running the Code <running_code>`. The only difference being the resulting
image, of course.

.. image:: pictures/sentinel_image.png
   :align: center

You'll need to scroll over Corsica, and you should see something that matches
the above image. If you do, then the server works!


Breaking Down the Code
=======================

This next section will go over how to prepare the RGB image to be
served. For a more of a general overview of to setup a tile server please see
:ref:`Greyscale Tile Server Code Breakdown <server_break_down>`.


Setup
------

.. code-block:: python

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      uri = "file:///tmp/sentinel-catalog"
      layer_name = "sentinel-example"

      geopysc = GeoPyContext(appName="s3-flask", master="local[*]")

      with open('/tmp/sentinel_stats.txt', 'r') as f:
          lines = f.readlines()
          whole_max = int(lines[0])
          whole_min = int(lines[1])

      app.run()

In additon to setting up ``uri`` and ``layer_name``, we will also read in the
``max`` and ``min`` values that we saved earlier. These will be used when we
normalize a tile.


Preparing the Tile
------------------

.. code-block:: python

  # normalize the data so that it falls in the range of 0 - 255
  def make_image(arr):
      adjusted = ((arr - whole_min) * 255) / (whole_max - whole_min)
      return Image.fromarray(adjusted.astype('uint8')).resize((256, 256), Image.NEAREST).convert('L')

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/<int:zoom>/<int:x>/<int:y>.png")
  def tile(x, y, zoom):
      # fetch tile

      tile = read_value(geopysc, SPATIAL, uri, layer_name, zoom, x, y)
      arr = tile['data']

      bands = arr.shape[0]
      arrs = [np.array(arr[x, :, :]).reshape(256, 256) for x in range(bands)]

      # display tile
      images = [make_image(arr) for arr in arrs]
      image = Image.merge('RGB', images)


Tiles that contain multibands need some work done before they can be served.
The ``make_image`` method takes each band and normalizes it between a range
of 0 and 255. We need to do this because ``PIL`` expects the data types of
arrays to be ``uint8``. This is why we need the ``whole_max`` and the
``whole_min`` values; as we needed to know full range of the original values
before normalization. Information that would be otherwise impossible to get at
this point.

Once normalized, the band is then converted to a greyscale image. This is done
for each band in the tile, and once complete, we can then make a RGB ``png``
file. After this step, the remaining process is no different than if you were
working with a singleband tile.

Any details that we not discussed in this document can be found in
:ref:`Greyscale Tile Server Code Breakdown <server_break_down>`.
