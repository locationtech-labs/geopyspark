"""Methods for working with, and creating tile layers.

A tile layer a is a RDD of tuples that contain tuples of (K, V) with Metadata. Where K is an index
that represents where V is within the overall tile layout. V is always a tile that contains the
spatial/spatial-temporal information of that area. Metadata contains the projection, layout, and
area information of the layer.

                        maxKey (dict): Represents where the tile layer ends in the gird.

                        The fields that are used to represent the minKey and maxKey:
                            col (int): The column number of the grid, runs east to west.
                            row (int): The row number of the grid, runs north to south.
        dest_crs (str): The CRS that the tiles should be reprojected to. Must be in well-known name
            format. This can be same,or a different than what's in the tile_layer_metadata.
        match_layer_extent (bool): Should the reprojection attempt to match the total layer's
            extent. Defaults to False. This should only be used with small extents, as seems can
            occur if the extent is too large.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (reprojected_rdd, metadata).
            projected_rdd (RDD): A RDD that contains data only for that layer represented as
                tuples of dictionaries.

                key (dict): The index of the tile within the layer. There are two different
                    types of keys, SpatialKeys and SpaceTimeKeys. SpatialKeys deal with data that
                    have just a spatial component, whereas SpaceTimeKeys are for data with both a
                    spatial and time component.

                    Both SpatialKeys and SpaceTimeKeys share these fields:
                        col (int): The column number of the grid, runs east to west.
                        row (int): The row number of the grid, runs north to south.

                    SpaceTimeKeys also have an additional field:
                        instant (int): The time stamp of the tile.
                tile (dict): The data of the tile.

                    The fields to represent the tile:
                        data (np.ndarray): The tile data itself is represented as a 3D, numpy
                            array.  Note, even if the data was originally singleband, it will
                            be reformatted as a multiband tile and read and saved as such.
                        no_data_value (optional): The no data value of the tile. Can be a range of
                            types including None.

                dict: The dictionary representation of the RDD's metadata.
                    The fields that are used to represent the metadata:

                        layoutDefinition (dict): Defines the raster layout of the rasters.

                        The fields that are used to represent the layoutDefinition:
                            extent (dict): The area covered by the layout tiles.
                            tileLayout (dict): The tile layout of the rasters.

                        crs (str): The CRS that the rasters are projected in.
                        bounds (dict): Represents the positions of the tile layer's tiles within
                            a gird.  These positions are represented by keys. There are two
                            different types of keys, SpatialKeys and SpaceTimeKeys. SpatialKeys are
                            for data that only have a spatial component while SpaceTimeKeys are for
                            data with both spatial and temporal components.

                            Both SpatialKeys and SpaceTimeKeys share these fields:
                                The fields that are used to represent the bounds:

                                    maxKey (dict): Represents where the tile layer ends in the gird.

                                    The fields that are used to represent the minKey and maxKey:

                cellType (str): The value type of every cell within the rasters.
                layoutDefinition (dict): Defines the raster layout of the rasters.

                The fields that are used to represent the layoutDefinition:
                    extent (dict): The area covered by the layout tiles.
                    tileLayout (dict): The tile layout of the rasters.
                extent (dict): The extent that covers the tiles.
                crs (str): The CRS that the rasters are projected in.
                bounds (dict): Represents the positions of the tile layer tiles within a gird.

                    The fields that are used to represent the bounds:
                        minKey (dict): Represents where the tile layer begins in the gird.
                        maxKey (dict): Represents where the tile layer ends in the gird.

                        The fields that are used to represent the minKey and maxKey:
                            col (int): The column number of the grid, runs east to west.
                            row (int): The row number of the grid, runs north to south.

    Returns:
        tile (dict): The data of the tile.

            The fields to represent the tile:
                data (np.ndarray): The tile data itself is represented as a 3D, numpy
                    array.  Note, even if the data was originally singleband, it will
                    be reformatted as a multiband tile and read and saved as such.
                no_data_value (optional): The no data value of the tile. Can be a range of
                    types including None.
